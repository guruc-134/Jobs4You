To Do List :
Create a React App to display content in the form of cards.
- Use this ( https://remotive.io/api/remote-jobs ) Rest API to fetch data
- Redirect to a specific card details page when clicked, which will include (All Data from API)
- Make a search bar for jobs according to the title.
- Create a filter to search jobs by their category, Job type, sort jobs according to publication date.
- Add Pagination only 20 jobs should be visible initially and show rest of the jobs when user clicks on another page.
- For each job card add a button called "add tags" which will ask for users input
- Whatever user types should be displayed in form of tags maximum 3 tags and user can give all 3 tags in the same input separated by commas " , ".


Note:
API has a limit so don't over use it it will block your IP
Create a clean and good UI
Use linting and comments in your code
Create a Github repo and do all the changes there while developing
